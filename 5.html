        <p>Scarlett Dragna has never left the <i><u><b>tiny</b></u></i> island where she and her sister, Tella, live with their <i><u><b>powerful</b></u></i>, and <i><u><b>cruel</b></i></u>, father. Now Scarlett’s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval—the faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show—are over.

                But this year, Scarlett’s <u><i><b>long</b></i></u>-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a <u><i><b>mysterious</b></i></u> sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only, as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval’s <u><i><b>mastermind</b></i></u> organizer, <u><i><b>Legend</b></i></u>. It turns out that this season’s Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.
                
                Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an <u><i><b>elaborate performance</b></i></u>. Nevertheless she becomes enmeshed in a game of <u><i><b>love, heartbreak, and magic</b></i></u>.</p>
